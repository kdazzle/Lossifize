This program is a Work in Progress. As such, command line calls will be ugly.

To call the program, do something like this:
  python ./lossifize.py -f /path/to/file -c 30000

or do python ./lossifize.py -h for help

What is the program? 
  It is a short and simple program aimed at making an image as lossy as possible.
Unfortunately, this is really slow, because the only way to do this is perform an obscenely large amount of duplication.

It also seems necessary to add some pixels to a file, because mere duplication doesn't seem to do the trick in
any reasonable amount of time. This adds to the complexity, of course: one random rgb pixel is generated at a random
(x,y) location each time the image is duplicated.

This seems to screw up the file enough.

The process is:
  Take a file
  Make it a little smaller?
  Duplicate that file
  Add a random pixel at a random location
  Duplicate the duplicate
  Add a random pixel at a random location
  Duplicate the duplicate of the duplicate
  Add a random pixel at a random location
  ...
  ...

Only the files at given intervals are kept. The rest are removed immediately.
This will make your computer real slow without a restart.
