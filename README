I know, I know, this program should just have been written by rotating the image and saving it or something,
but I didn't know this when I wrote it. Below is the original readme.

============================================

Everyone is always talking about how jpegs are lossy, so I wanted to see how many saves it would take before any loss became noticeable.
After hundreds of thousands of saves I couldn't see a difference, so I decided to force some deterioration.

What is the program? 
	It is an experiment aimed at making an image as lossy as possible. Unfortunately, this is really slow, because the only way to do this is to perform an obscenely large amount of duplication.
 
To call the program, do something like this:
  python ./lossifize.py -f /path/to/file -c 30000

or do python ./lossifize.py -h for help

Only the files at given intervals are kept. The rest are removed immediately.
This will make your computer really slow without a restart.

For some results, I have provided samples in ./sample. They were probably not as interesting as I was hoping for. 

Maybe next time I'll just try saving them at a lower quality...
